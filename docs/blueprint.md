# **App Name**: LookSync

## Core Features:

- Occasion-Based Look Generation: AI-powered generation of complete outfit looks based on the selected occasion, budget, skin tone, body type, and style preferences, leveraging OpenAI API to build a prompt, parse the response, and map to the database to find matching or similar products. Use a tool to generate outfits and suggest complementary accessories and makeup.
- AI Color Palette Matcher: Suggests matching footwear colors, lipstick shades, jewelry metal tones, and bag colors based on a user-uploaded image of fabric or outfit, using AI to extract the dominant color and provide a visual color harmony wheel.
- Wardrobe Management with AI Gap Analysis: Analyzes user-uploaded photos of owned items (clothes, shoes, bags) and suggests missing pieces to complete various looks, identifying gaps such as 'You need a nude heel and gold earrings to complete this look'.
- Look Gallery & Exploration: Presents a grid of pre-curated complete looks, filterable by occasion, budget, color, season, and style, with each look being shoppable via affiliate links and offering like/save/share functionality.
- User Profile & Saved Looks Management: Dashboard for users to view and manage saved looks, style profile, and order history if purchases are made through the platform, allowing customization of preferences.
- Brand/Seller Product Portal: Allows brands to list their products with relevant tags (category, color HEX, occasion tags, price, sizes) and provides an analytics dashboard for product performance monitoring.
